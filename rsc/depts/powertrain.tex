% \definedept defines the department. LaTeX keeps track of all the departments defined, and the template uses it to match with the \dept{Powertrain} in main.tex to output the authors.
% The first argument is the name of the department. It has to match exactly with the name in the \dept command.
% The second argument is the name of the lead.
% The third argument is the name of everyone else in the department.
\definedept{Powertrain}{Rok Å tular}{Sam Waterman, Dirk-Jan Kragt, Jan Wanatowicz}

% You are allowed to define other commands / environments in here to be a part of the template, so long as you stick to the guidelines defined in DSS section of the template guidelines.
