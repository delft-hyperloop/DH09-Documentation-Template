% \definedept defines the department. LaTeX keeps track of all the departments defined, and the template uses it to match with the \dept{Propulsion} in main.tex to output the authors.
% The first argument is the name of the department. It has to match exactly with the name in the \dept command.
% The second argument is the name of the lead.
% The third argument is the name of everyone else in the department.
