\chapter{Background and Literature} \label{chapter:bg-and-literature}
This chapter should put the reader up to speed to fully understand the design (given some basic knowledge of course). No need to cover everything in detail, if explanations can be found in a source just reference it. Include at least the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item All research done to reach the current level of knowledge
    \item All sources used 
    \item Any talks with experts (if relevant)
    \item All knowledge that might not come from a specific source, but from engineering judgment/general knowledge acquired from the bachelor
    \item Designs from last year if it's relevant to the design of this year or it cannot be found in any specific source
\end{itemize}
